Questions about the data:
	- Try on the original Sentinel-1 SAR Images, instead of 8bit

Overfitting, even with massive amounts of dropout

Lengthy training process, try using early stopping rounds based on val loss.

Training loss plateaus, and outputs still aren't comprehensible, try less regularisation/less LR decay?

!!! Try using DataParallelism with Pytorch, to utilise multiple GPU's (training speed might scale linearly with # of GPU's, ignoring memory overhead since A100s with NVLink are supposed to be "pooling" memory)

If time permits, try on regular segmentation datasets, like COCO/cityscapes.
	How is segmenting SAR images different from segmenting for COCO, in terms of NNs?
	Try comparing with EuroSAT benchmarks https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/eurosat
