## Land use and land cover segmentation
This repository contains <b> highly unorganized code </b> for my land use and land cover project. Uploading to GitHub for posterity. The PyTorch model files (.pt) were generated for checkpointing, but can't be uploaded here due to the 100MB limit.

The work involved a <b> <i> lot of experimentation </b> </i> so there are a lot of "junk" files that I haven't cleaned up. Most of these files are just Python scripts or notebooks containing PyTorch or TensorFlow models and/or operations
